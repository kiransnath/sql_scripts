--The problem was to get the names listed as per their job. The table was linear and we have to transpose to list in this way

select Doctor,Professor,Singer,Actor from (
(select name,occupation, row_number() over (partition by occupation order by name) as rno
from occupations)
pivot (min(name) for occupation in ('Doctor' as Doctor,'Professor' as Professor,'Singer' as Singer,'Actor' as Actor))
)
order by rno
;
